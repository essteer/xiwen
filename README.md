A tool to scan HTML for Chinese characters.

## Overview 

Use Xiwen to scan websites for Chinese characters — hanzi — and:

- analyse the content by HSK grade
- identify character variants
- export character sets for further use

The analysis describes the breakdown by HSK grade (see below) and character lists can be exported for any combination of those levels, or less common hanzi beyond the HSK grades.

Data exports provide hanzi by HSK grade in traditional and simplified Chinese, their pinyin, count within the text, and character frequency.

## Who this is for

Mandarin learners can use Xiwen to determine the expected difficulty of an article or book relative to their current reading level, and create character lists for further study.

Instructors can use it to assess the suitability of reading materials for their students, and produce vocabulary lists.

## HSK

HSK — Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi 汉语水平考试 — is a series of examinations designed to test Chinese language proficiency in simplified Chinese.

In its latest form the HSK consists of nine levels, and covers 3,000 simplified hanzi and 11,092 vocabulary items. The advanced levels — seven to nine — share 1,200 hanzi that are tested together.

To approximate a traditional hanzi version of the HSK, Xiwen maps the HSK hanzi to traditional Chinese equivalents. In most cases this is a one-to-one conversion, but in several cases there are two or more traditional hanzi that reflect distinct meanings of the single simplified character.

For example:

- "发": ["發", "髮"]
- "了": ["了", "瞭"]
- "面": ["面", "麵"]

Or even:

- "只": ["只", "衹", "隻"]
- "台": ["台", "檯", "臺", "颱"]

A list of these "polymaps" — not all of which relate to hanzi in the HSK — can be found in the Wikipedia article [Ambiguous character mappings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguities_in_Chinese_character_simplification).

This approach isn't perfect: obscure definitions implied by a distinct traditional hanzi may be far less frequent than the common conversion of a simplified hanzi.

The table below lists the number of simplified hanzi per grade, and the number of mappings to traditional equivalents.

| HSK Grade | Simp. Hanzi | Running Total | Trad. Hanzi Equivalents | Running Total |
| :-------: | :---------: | :-----------: | :---------------------: | :-----------: |
|    [1]    |     300     |      300      |           313           |      313      |
|    [2]    |     300     |      600      |           314           |      627      |
|    [3]    |     300     |      900      |           312           |      939      |
|    [4]    |     300     |     1200      |           316           |     1255      |
|    [5]    |     300     |     1500      |           310           |     1565      |
|    [6]    |     300     |     1800      |           310           |     1875      |
|   [7-9]   |    1200     |     3000      |          1214           |     3089      |

## Installation

### GitHub repo

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-xiwen-181717.svg?flat&logo=GitHub&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/essteer/xiwen)

Clone the `xiwen` repo from GitHub for the full source code. The repo includes the CSV and text files used to generate the character lists and a test suite.

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:essteer/xiwen
```

Change into the `xiwen` directory then create and activate a virtual environment — the below example uses [Astral's](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) `uv`; substitute `pip` or use another package manager as needed — then install the `dev` dependencies:

```console
$ uv venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Operation

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-xiwen-181717.svg?flat&logo=GitHub&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/essteer/xiwen)

Run `xiwen/interface.py` from the `src` directory to launch the CLI program.

`resources/main.py` makes use of datasets in `resources/assets` to pair simplified and traditional character sets with their pinyin, HSK grades, and character frequencies as identified in the MTSU dataset.

Xiwen relies on a Parquet file produced from those resources and located at `xiwen/assets`. This file can be replaced as needed — update the file name loaded in `xiwen/app.py` to make use of a custom file.

`xiwen/interface.py` is the interactive component of the CLI version of Xiwen. It receives user input and makes function calls to modules in `xiwen/utils`. Those files form the program's ETL pipeline including the following functions:

- break down text into individual hanzi (`filter_text()`)
- sort hanzi as HSK-level simplified or traditional hanzi, or outliers (`partition_hanzi()`)
- determine the overall character variant of the text as simplified or traditional, or a mix (`identify_variant()`)
- compute the grade-based and cumulative numbers of unique hanzi and total hanzi in the text (`analyse()`)

Character sets can then be exported to .csv.
